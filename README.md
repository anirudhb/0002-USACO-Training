# USACO training repository

This is a repository containing my solutions to the USACO training challenges.
Solutions are written in C++ (I would use Rust if it was supported!)

## Automated testing

**TODO**

All of my solutions go through automated test harnesses for each commit.
These harnesses ensure that I'm not merging broken code.
They are all tested with the provided training data.
